QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: 

The program will modify register 2 when it is run. it will contain decimal number 12 when the program finishes. 


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 

I think that the ability to step through a program is a very useful tool for debugging a program because it allows us to walk through our code one by one and find the error easiler than using "continue" feature. Also, "step" allows me to step through the process and see where I am making a mistake.
