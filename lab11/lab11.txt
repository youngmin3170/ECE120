wQuestion 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
one error occurs because there is no ".ORIG" to start the program.
Another error occurs when it tried to subtract 1 by using x3010. It is supposed to be xFFFF.
Another error occurs when there is extra comma on line 19.
I need to load zero to R5.
I need to change BRpz to BRzp. I think it checks the outer count was zero first. 


Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
I have two labels, outerloop and innerloop, in the code.
Outerloop: x3005
InnerLoop: x3006


Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
I think using labels the most sense becuase labels make referring to specific locations much easier and clearer. Also, labels make branching easier.
